## What did you do last week?

Added a gun animation, and sound effects.

## What will you do next week?

This week I got it so the gun can shoot, and consume ammo.
Next week, I would like it to not go into the negative numbers when I shoot,
and hopefully some AI.

## Do you have any blockers?

No.
