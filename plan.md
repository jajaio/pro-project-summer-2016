# SkilStak Pro Project Plan - Summer 2016

*For my project this summer, I will be making a FPS(First Person Shooter)
in the Unity3D engine. You will be able to move around and shoot things,
and I plan to put in on my website once it's finished. I may add custom
textures later on, but for now I'm using some that others have made.*

## Objectives

*I want to learn a lot about the Unity3D engine. I had taken a camp
on it about a year ago, but I'm pretty rusty. After Skilstak Pro, 
I want to go on and make even more Unity3D games.*


## Reference Links
TO be completed.

*Most Pro projects will have one or more other repos or even an
organization to contain the actual source code. Link to it here.
The idea is that the projects created in Pro could live on their
own without being associated with the SkilStak Pro program.*
