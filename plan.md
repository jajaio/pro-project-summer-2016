# SkilStak Pro Project Plan - Summer 2016

For my project this summer, I will be making a FPS(First Person Shooter)
in the Unity3D engine. You will be able to move around and shoot things,
and I plan to put in on my website once it's finished. I may add custom
textures later on, but for now I'm using some that others have made.

## Objectives

I want to learn a lot about the Unity3D engine. I had taken a camp
on it about a year ago, but I'm pretty rusty. After Skilstak Pro, 
I want to go on and make even more Unity3D games.
