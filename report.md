# SkilStak Pro Final Report - Summer 2016

For this semester of SkilStak Pro, I made a simple FPS(First Person Shooter) in Unity3D.
You can move around, pick up ammo, and shoot your gun at targets.
It's very simple, and I'd like to continue working on it sometime, if not next semester.


## Lessons Learned

Next time, I'd like to plan out what I want before I start writing code.
I went in with the mindset of "I'll just plan it out as I go!" and it resulted with
nothing really original about the game. Yes, the overall game isn't finished,
but it would've made the game easier to make if I knew what I wanted it to be in the end.
Overall, this has been a great experience for me to get the hang of Unity.

## Next Steps

Well, My friend asked if I wanted to work with him on another Unity project, so I'll probably pursue that.
If I don't work on that, then I'll continue this game, and make more to do. Now that I'm familiar with Unity,
I can practically do whatever I want.
